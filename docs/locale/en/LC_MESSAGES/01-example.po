"This method is static. See the ``.rst`` source file for how this is defined."
" Also notice that this method appears in the TOC, there is no section "
"heading in the actual body of the document. This is because of a custom "
"``hidden`` role which hides the heading in the body, but lets Sphinx render "
"it in the TOC. If you just put a heading there without the \"hidden\" part, "
"you'd get the same result, except that the heading would show in the content"
" as well, thus duplicating the function name."
